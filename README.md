# Canasta Game
Welcome to the Canasta Game project! This project is an implementation of the classic card game Canasta, created as a post-university learning project. Originally conceived as a simpler version during university as a group project, this iteration represents a significant improvement and a personal challenge to refine and enhance the gameplay experience.

## Background
After completing a basic version of Canasta during university, the decision was made to revisit the project with the aim of implementing a more robust and feature-rich version. However, during development, an unforeseen issue arose when the project files were almost lost due to a hard drive failure. Fortunately, what you see in this repository is a recovered version extracted from an executable found on a damaged hard drive, preserving the work done up to that point.

## Features
### Small Server and Client: 
The game architecture consists of a compact server and client setup. The server handles game logic and facilitates communication between clients, while the client provides the user interface for gameplay interaction.

### Multiplayer Support: 
Connect to the server using the client application and engage in multiplayer games with up to four players. Enjoy the social aspect of Canasta by playing with friends or other online players.

### GUI with JavaFX: 
The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using JavaFX, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface for players to interact with the game. Enjoy smooth animations, responsive controls, and a polished user experience.

### Written in Java:
The project is primarily written in Java, leveraging its versatility and platform independence. Java's object-oriented nature and rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks contribute to the project's stability and maintainability.
